Definición de las variables listadas
Heliofanía (Hrs.)
"Heliofanía Hs se obtiene a partir de la “lectura” de la banda de heliofanía que va sobre el heliofanógrafo. Se contabilizan las porciones de la banda que fueron quemadas por el sol, y la suma de estas equivale a las horas de insolación directa. 
Para el caso de la estación de INIA Las Brujas, a partir del 21 de diciembre de 2020 no se realiza más  “lectura” de banda.  Las  horas  de  insolación  directa se estiman a partir de un modelo ajustado, para esa estación en particular, entre datos de radiación solar de la estación meteorológica automática y radiación calculada a partir de heliofanógrafo. La estación automática se encuentra en el mismo predio donde está ubicado el helioganógrafo. 
El ajuste del modelo se hizo con datos del 2011 a 2019 inclusive, y considera el mes del año para el cual se estiman las horas de insolación. La validación  del  modelo se hizo con datos de enero a noviembre de 2020. El modelo ajustado tiene un R2=0.9446 y un RMSE=0.975 horas entre las horas de insolación por banda y horas de insolación estimadas por el modelo ajustado. Para el período de validación, por banda de heliofanógrafo se contabilizaron 2513.9 horas, y por modelo ajustado 2534.5 horas. Una diferencia de 20.6 horas entre ambos métodos, lo que equivale a un 0.82% de sobreestimación del modelo ajustado."

Precip. Acumulada (mm)
"Precipitación acumulada diaria, medida convencionalmente"

Heliofanía Relativa (%)
Relación porcentual entre el valor real y la insolación máxima posible (tabulada de acuerdo a la latitud) para ese día del año.

Rad.Solar (xHelio)cal/cm²
"La Radiación Solar se calcula por fórmula de Angstrom, la cual relaciona la radiación solar con la radiación extraterrestre y la duración relativa de la insolación."

Precip. Efectiva (mm)
"Es la precipitación del día, descontando el escurrimiento superficial."

Llovió (S:1/N:0)
Refiere a si ese día precipitó (indicado con 1) o no se registró precipitación (indicado con 0).
